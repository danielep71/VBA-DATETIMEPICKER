Thank you for helping improve **VBA Date / Time Picker**.

Contributions are welcome when they strengthen correctness, clarity,
maintainability, compatibility, documentation, tests, or reproducibility. The
standard is not simply that a change works once: another person must be able to
review it, reproduce the evidence, and understand its operational boundaries.

Participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Report suspected vulnerabilities privately under [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md);
never disclose sensitive details in a public issue or pull request.

## 🧭 Start here

Before opening work:

1. Read the README, this guide, the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
   [Security Policy](SECURITY.md), and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
2. Search open and closed issues and pull requests for related work.
3. Open an issue before a non-trivial feature, public-API change, dependency,
   architectural change, compatibility break, or broad refactor.
4. Agree the observable contract and validation approach before implementation.
5. Keep credentials, personal/client data, proprietary workbooks, and restricted
   reference material out of the repository.

Small documentation corrections and narrowly obvious fixes may go directly to a
focused pull request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not reintroduce implicit whole-table-column writes, blanket event enabling,
> stale full-style restoration, or uncoordinated runtime registration. These are
> compatibility and data-safety boundaries, not implementation preferences.

## 🌱 Ways to contribute

| Contribution | Good first action |
|---|---|
| 🐛 Reproducible defect | Open an issue with minimal inputs, expected behavior, observed behavior, and environment. |
| ✨ Feature or API change | Open an issue describing users, contract, alternatives, compatibility, and validation. |
| 🧪 Tests or reference evidence | Explain provenance, independence, precision, coverage, and expected failure detection. |
| 📖 Documentation | Identify the affected behavior and keep examples executable and current. |
| ⚙️ Repository/tooling | Explain developer impact, failure behavior, portability, and maintenance cost. |
| 🔐 Security concern | Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); do not open a public report. |
| 💬 Usage question | Use the repository's supported discussion or issue channel without sensitive data. |

A proposal may be adapted, deferred, or declined when it is out of scope,
duplicates an existing capability, weakens a contract, or creates maintenance
cost disproportionate to its benefit.

## 📁 Repository model

This is a **source-first Excel UI component**. The Git diff, not an opaque workbook, is
the review artifact.

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/` | Authoritative production modules, classes, UserForm text, `.frx` resources, and RibbonX |
| `test/` | Regression and host-lifecycle tests |
| `demo/` | Demo source and deterministic workbook builders |
| `docs/` | Contracts, architecture, installation, and release guidance |
| `tools/` | Static checks and release/evidence tooling |

The README and current tree are authoritative if a listed optional directory is
not present.

<a id="development-workflow"></a>

## 🌿 Development workflow

1. Fork or clone the repository and start from the current `main`.
2. Create a short, focused branch such as `fix/clear-description`,
   `feat/clear-description`, `docs/clear-description`, or
   `test/clear-description`.
3. Reproduce the existing behavior before changing it.
4. Define the intended contract, affected callers, compatibility impact, and
   evidence plan.
5. Make the smallest coherent source change; do not mix unrelated formatting,
   refactoring, generated files, or cleanup.
6. Compile and run the relevant static, regression, host, and manual checks.
7. Re-export changed VBA components and review the complete text/binary diff.
8. Update documentation and release notes required by the change.
9. Push the branch and open a pull request with evidence and limitations.

Repository maintainers may use the repository's configured direct-push workflow
where permitted. External contributions and reviewable portfolio changes should
use branches and pull requests.

### Commit discipline

Write imperative, specific subjects, normally in this form:

```text
fix: preserve formulas during write-back
feat: add explicit tail calculation
test: cover cleanup after initialization failure
docs: clarify supported Office environments
chore: harden repository validation
```

Keep commits reviewable. Reference the issue when one exists. Do not include
secrets, private links, generated attribution boilerplate, or unverifiable test
claims in commit messages.

## 📦 Source-first VBA

Exported source is authoritative.

- Use `Option Explicit`.
- Preserve the repository's VBE export metadata, module names, encoding, and
  line-ending policy.
- Match `.bas`, `.cls`, and `.frm` filenames to their component identity.
- Keep every required `.frm` / `.frx` pair together; treat `.frx` as binary.
- Do not edit a binary form resource as text.
- Do not use a workbook or add-in as the only record of a code change.
- Do not commit Office lock files, recovery copies, local exports, test output,
  or generated binaries unless the repository explicitly designates them as
  source.
- Qualify workbook, worksheet, range, and application references.
- Avoid implicit active-workbook, active-sheet, selection, and default-member
  dependencies.
- Keep `On Error Resume Next` scopes narrow and intentional.
- Preserve useful diagnostic context and clean up on success and failure.
- Avoid new references, APIs, dependencies, or platform assumptions until their
  support and deployment impact is agreed.

### Public contracts and compatibility

Treat documented procedures, functions, classes, enums, parameters, defaults,
return values, errors, side effects, workbook formats, and supported platforms
as contracts.

A contract-changing contribution must:

1. identify affected callers and migration needs;
2. explain what changes and what remains unchanged;
3. add or update regression coverage;
4. update user-facing documentation and examples; and
5. state whether the release impact is patch, minor, or major.

Do not make an internal helper public merely to simplify a test. Use an explicit
test seam where the project supports one.

### Excel state ownership

Assume these surfaces belong to the caller or host unless the project explicitly
owns them:

```text
Application.Calculation
Application.EnableEvents
Application.ScreenUpdating
Application.DisplayAlerts
Application.StatusBar
active workbook / worksheet / selection
window styles, shortcuts, timers, names, links, connections, and shapes
```

Capture state before changing it. Restore only state the component successfully
changed and still owns. Cleanup must not conceal the original failure.

## 🧩 Project engineering contract

| Area | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| **Source/binary boundary** | Track exported source and the required `UF_DatePicker.frx` companion; do not commit generated demo workbooks or add-ins. |
| **Runtime ownership** | Acquire the process-visible provider lease before shared registration; do not let providers dismantle one another's resources. |
| **Write-back** | Keep ordinary selection single-cell unless broad scope is explicit; ensure preview and application agree. |
| **Formula safety** | Preserve formulas by default; array formulas remain non-overridable and ordinary overwrite requires explicit opt-in. |
| **Application state** | Preserve caller-owned events, shortcuts, timers, context menus, shapes, active objects, and settings namespaces according to their contracts. |
| **Native windows** | Use bitness-safe declarations, distinguish valid zero returns from errors, and restore only style bits the component owns. |

## 🧪 Validation and evidence

Validation must be proportional to risk and reproducible from the exact source
under review.

- Compile the complete VBA project.
- Run `TST_DP_RunAll` for production changes.
- Run `TST_DP_RunAll_WithUISmoke`, `DP_Show`, and `DP_Close` for form/UI changes.
- Exercise affected provider-lease, write-back, formula, keyboard, timer, settings, and recovery paths.
- For native-window changes, test a real supported Windows host and the applicable 32/64-bit behavior.
- Record exact commit, Excel/Windows/Office bitness, test verdict, skipped paths, and cleanup result.

A source regression pass does not by itself certify a packaged `.xlam` or demo workbook. Release evidence must establish the relationship among the tested source, rebuilt asset, artifact hash, release notes, and tag.

### Evidence principles

- Test the behavior, not only the implementation path.
- Add a permanent regression for every corrected defect.
- Include ordinary, boundary, invalid-input, error, and cleanup paths.
- Use an independent source for expected numerical results.
- State skips and unavailable environments explicitly; a skipped check is not a
  pass.
- Do not claim compatibility, accuracy, performance, or certification beyond
  what was actually observed.
- Treat cleanup failures and incomplete runs as failures.
- Never generate expected values with the implementation under test.

### Suggested evidence block

```text
Source
------
Commit / tag:
Files or components changed:

Environment
-----------
Excel:
Office bitness:
Operating system:
Locale / date system:
Deployment or host:

Checks
------
Compile:
Static checks:
Focused tests:
Full regression:
Manual / UI / platform checks:
Cleanup:

Evidence
--------
Independent reference and version:
Inputs / workload:
Tolerance or acceptance rule:
Expected:
Observed:
Worst discrepancy / dispersion:

Limitations
-----------
Skipped or unverified:
Follow-up:
```

Remove non-applicable fields, but do not omit a material limitation.

## 📖 Documentation and release notes

Update the README, affected wiki/contract pages, examples, installation/recovery guidance, and the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes.

Documentation must say:

- what users can rely on;
- inputs, outputs, defaults, side effects, and failure behavior;
- supported and untested environments;
- installation or migration steps;
- numerical or platform assumptions; and
- any known limitation introduced or exposed by the change.

Do not edit a released version or tag merely to describe unreleased work. Release
numbers, artifacts, hashes, and dates belong to the repository's release
workflow.

---

## 🔐 Security, privacy, and provenance

- Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reports.
- Use synthetic, anonymized, or explicitly redistributable examples and data.
- Remove names, email addresses, account identifiers, workbook properties,
  document metadata, credentials, tokens, private URLs, and machine-specific
  paths.
- Verify the license and redistribution rights of copied code, formulas,
  reference tables, images, and generated material.
- Cite material algorithms and external reference data precisely enough for a
  reviewer to verify them.
- You remain responsible for the correctness, licensing, security, and
  reviewability of tool-assisted contributions.
